  |   R-Type and R-Type II, the legendary coin-op space shooters, are now   |
  |   together on Nintendo Switch!                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The coin-op classics, R-Type & R-Type II, are together on Nintendo    |
  |   Switch! Fight through all 14 Bydo-infested stages in retro 2D         |
  |   graphics or shiny 3D graphics - and swap back and forth with the      |
  |   touch of a button 'on-the-fly'. The new 3D graphics are accompanied   |
  |   by fully re-imagined arrangements of the timeless R-Type music        |
  |   tracks! The classic game-play remains untouched while the new         |
  |   Infinite game mode allows continuous progression from game start to   |
  |   final boss... the Bydo will not evade you this time! Both game        |
  |   modes can be played as single player or local multiplayer. Pull       |
  |   yourself together, save the earth and strike down the Evil Bydo       |
  |   Empire!!                                                              |

  |   * Two Complete Games!: All 8 original R-Type levels + all 6           |
  |     original R-Type II levels. Classic gameplay is unchanged and just   |
  |     as challenging as the original coin-op versions                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Hi-Res 3D Graphics + Fully Revamped Music!: Choose between 2D       |
  |     graphics with classic, retro music or shiny 3D graphics with        |
  |     snazzy, reworked music and sound effects. Switch between graphic    |
  |     and audio modes with the press of a button during play              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * New Infinite Mode!: With infinite ships you're sure to finally      |
  |     conquer the Bydos! Stage select allows you to practice and play     |
  |     the levels you want                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Classic Mode!: Play the classic R-Type & R-Type II just like the    |
  |     original version                                                    |

  |   * Co-Op Mode!: Go it alone or blast the Bydos with a buddy. Play      |
  |     friendly without collision, or flip it on for competitive play      |
  |                                                                         |
